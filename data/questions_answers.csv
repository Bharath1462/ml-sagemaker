question,answer
What is Amazon EC2?,"Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing you to run virtual servers."
How does AWS Lambda work?,"AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning servers. You upload your code, and Lambda automatically runs and scales it in response to events."
What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?,"IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using machine-readable definition files, rather than manual processes. Tools like AWS CloudFormation and Terraform are examples."
Explain Continuous Integration (CI).,"CI is a DevOps practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository, followed by automated builds and tests to detect issues early."
What is an AWS VPC?,A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network you define.
How do you secure an AWS S3 bucket?,"You secure S3 buckets by setting bucket policies, enabling encryption (at-rest and in-transit), applying IAM roles, and configuring access logging and versioning."
What is Docker?,"Docker is a platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers."
What is the purpose of AWS CloudWatch?,"CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service for AWS resources and applications, collecting logs, metrics, and events for operational insights."
How does Kubernetes help in DevOps?,"Kubernetes automates container orchestration, allowing teams to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications efficiently, supporting continuous deployment and reliability."
What is a CI/CD pipeline?,"A CI/CD pipeline automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying software to production environments continuously and reliably."
Explain the difference between AWS IAM roles and policies.,IAM roles are identities with permissions policies that can be assumed by users or services. Policies define the permissions granted.
What is Amazon RDS?,Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed database service that supports several database engines and automates administrative tasks.
What are the benefits of using AWS Elastic Beanstalk?,"Elastic Beanstalk simplifies application deployment by handling provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and monitoring automatically."
What is the blue-green deployment strategy?,"Blue-green deployment involves running two identical environments: one live (blue) and one idle (green). New code is deployed to green, and traffic is switched over when ready, minimizing downtime."
How can you automate AWS resource provisioning?,"Automation can be achieved using Infrastructure as Code tools like AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, or AWS CDK, allowing declarative resource definitions."
What is the function of AWS CodePipeline?,"CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that automates the build, test, and deploy phases of release workflows."
How does AWS Elastic Load Balancer work?,"It distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, to improve fault tolerance and availability."
What is the purpose of Docker Compose?,Docker Compose is a tool to define and run multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML configuration file.
What are AWS Security Groups?,Security Groups act as virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic for AWS resources like EC2 instances.
Explain the concept of immutable infrastructure.,"Immutable infrastructure means once deployed, servers are never modified; any updates result in new servers being provisioned and old ones retired, improving stability."
What is a Canary deployment?,"A Canary deployment rolls out changes to a small subset of users before a full rollout, allowing for monitoring and rollback if issues occur."
How do you monitor AWS Lambda functions?,"You use AWS CloudWatch Logs and Metrics to monitor invocation count, duration, error rates, and throttling."
What is a container registry?,"A container registry stores and distributes Docker container images, such as Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)."
What is AWS CloudTrail?,"CloudTrail records AWS API calls and events for your account, enabling auditing, compliance, and operational troubleshooting."
What is the difference between a Docker container and a virtual machine?,"Containers share the host OS kernel and isolate applications, making them lightweight and fast, whereas virtual machines run full OS instances on hypervisors."
How can you implement secrets management in AWS?,"Use AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store, manage, and retrieve secrets such as database credentials."
What is the use of AWS Auto Scaling?,Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of compute resources based on demand to maintain performance and optimize costs.
What is the difference between Stateful and Stateless applications?,"Stateless applications do not retain client state between requests, making them easier to scale; Stateful applications maintain session or data state."
How do you rollback a deployment in AWS CodeDeploy?,You can configure automatic rollback on failure or manually initiate a rollback to the previous revision through the AWS Console or CLI.
What is the purpose of AWS Systems Manager?,"AWS Systems Manager provides a unified interface to view and control your infrastructure, automate operational tasks, and securely manage resources."
